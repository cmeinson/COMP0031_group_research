# RQ4. Scalability with more sensitive attributes:
**RQ4. Scalability with more sensitive attributes:**
*How do the FairBalance and FairMask perform when applied to more than 2 sensitive attributes?* 
Both papers use no more than 2 sensitive attributes at once, which is not always the case in practical applications. We test how the methods scale in terms of runtime complexity and how the presence of a higher number of protected subgroups reflects on the predictive performance and fairness of the models.


As part of this research question, we research the impact of increased protected attributes on the runtime complexity of the algorithms and accuracy.
