##RQ4. **Scalability with more sensitive attributes:** 
*How do the FairBalance and FairMask perform when applied to more than 2 sensitive attributes?* 
Both papers use no more than 2 sensitive attributes at once, which is not always the case in practical applications. We test how the methods scale in terms of runtime complexity and how the presence of a higher number of protected subgroups reflects on the predictive performance and fairness of the models.
